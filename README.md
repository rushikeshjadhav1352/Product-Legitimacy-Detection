# Product-Legitimacy-Detection
Product Legitimacy Detection using blockchain is a system that uses blockchain technology to verify the authenticity of products and ensure that they are not counterfeit or fake.


1)Product Legitimacy Detection in blockchain refers to the use of blockchain technology to verify the authenticity of products and to ensure that they are not counterfeit or fake. This technology works by assigning a unique identifier, such as a QR code, to each product. This identifier is then recorded as a transaction on the blockchain. When a product is purchased, the buyer can scan the code to verify its authenticity and determine if it is part of the blockchain record.

2)The use of blockchain technology provides several advantages in product legitimacy detection. Firstly, it offers decentralization, as the blockchain is a decentralized ledger that is not controlled by any single entity, which reduces the risk of manipulation or fraud. Secondly, it offers immutability, as transactions recorded on the blockchain are permanent and cannot be altered, which ensures the accuracy and integrity of the information.

3)Additionally, the use of blockchain technology allows for the full traceability of products from the point of origin to the final customer, making it easier to identify and prevent the sale of counterfeit products. The decentralized and transparent nature of the blockchain also allows for greater transparency in the supply chain, making it easier to detect and prevent counterfeit products from entering the market.
